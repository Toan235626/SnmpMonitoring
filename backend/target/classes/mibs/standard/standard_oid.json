When set, this variable causes a Start or Stop event on the specified neighbor, as specified on pages 8-10 of RFC 904. Briefly, a Start event causes an Idle peer to begin neighbor acquisition and a non-Idle peer to reinitiate neighbor acquisition. A stop event causes a non-Idle peer to return to the Idle state until a Start event occurs, either via egpNeighEventTrigger or otherwise. Enumeration: 'start': 1, 'stop': 2.",

This source can be any ethernet interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated etherStatsStatus object is equal to valid(1).",

The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.",

The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.",

In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated hostControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).",

This index shall be between 1 and N, where N is the value of the associated hostControlTableSize. The ordering of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier have a lower index value than entries added later. It is important to note that the order for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a previous association between a value of hostCreationOrder and a hostEntry may no longer hold.",

This index shall be between 1 and N, where N is the value of the associated hostControlTableSize. The ordering of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier have a lower index value than entries added later. Thus the management station has the ability to learn of new entries added to this table without downloading the entire table. It is important to note that the index for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTimeTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a download of the table may have missed entries, and where a previous association between a value of hostTimeCreationOrder and a hostTimeEntry may no longer hold.",

This source can be any interface on this device.

For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated matrixControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).",

The errors and the bits that represent them are dependent on the media type of the interface that this channel is receiving packets from.

Each octet within the value of this object specifies a set of eight ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through 8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc. Within each octet, the most significant bit represents the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit represents the highest numbered port. Thus, each port of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the value of this object. If that bit has a value of '1', then that port is included in the set of ports; the port is not included if its bit has a value of '0'. (Note that the setting of the bit corresponding to the port from which a frame is received is irrelevant.) The default value of this object is a string of ones of appropriate length. The value of this object may exceed the required minimum maximum message size of some SNMP transport (484 bytes, in the case of SNMP over UDP, see RFC 3417, section 3.2). SNMP engines on bridges supporting a large number of ports must support appropriate maximum message sizes.",

Storage such as tapes and floppies without file systems on them are typically not allocated in chunks by the operating system to requesting applications, and therefore shouldn't appear in this table. Examples of valid storage for this table include disk partitions, file systems, ram (for some architectures this is further segmented into regular memory, extended memory, and so on), backing store for virtual memory (`swap space').

                                "description": "This table contains one entry per interface. It defines objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent to test an interface for various faults. Tests for an interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that interface. After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to determine the outcome. If an agent can not perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate. The object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test- specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific) information concerning the outcome of the test. Only one test can be in progress on each interface at any one time. If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the second test is rejected. Some agents may reject a test when a prior test is active on another interface. Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the interface to be tested. This is accomplished with the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows: try_again: get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) while (ifTestStatus != notInUse) /* * Loop while a test is running or some other * manager is configuring a test. */ short delay get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) } /* * Is not being used right now -- let's compete * to see who gets it. */ lock_value = ifTestId if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse, ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE) /* * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go * try again */ goto try_again; /* * I have the lock */ set up any test parameters. /* * This starts the test */ set(ifTestType = test_to_run); wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse' retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid A manager station first retrieves the value of the appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'. The manager station then tries to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself. If the set operation succeeds then the manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the semantics of TestAndIncr). Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry. Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType. On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to 'notInUse'. Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the results. In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be a possibility that the first test's results might be overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first results being read. This unlikely circumstance can be detected by a network manager retrieving ifTestId at the same time as retrieving the test results, and ensuring that the results are for the desired request. If ifTestType is not set within an abnormally long period of time after ownership is obtained, the agent should time-out the manager, and reset the value of the ifTestStatus object back to 'notInUse'. It is suggested that this time-out period be 5 minutes. In general, a management station must not retransmit a request to invoke a test for which it does not receive a response; instead, it properly inspects an agent's MIB to determine if the invocation was successful. Only if the invocation was unsuccessful, is the invocation request retransmitted. Some tests may require the interface to be taken off-line in order to execute them, or may even require the agent to reboot after completion of the test. In these circumstances, communication with the management station invoking the test may be lost until after completion of the test. An agent is not required to support such tests. However, if such tests are supported, then the agent should make every effort to transmit a response to the request which invoked the test prior to losing communication. When the agent is restored to normal service, the results of the test are properly made available in the appropriate objects. Note that this requires that the ifIndex value assigned to an interface must be unchanged even if the test causes a reboot. An agent must reject any test for which it cannot, perhaps due to resource constraints, make available at least the minimum amount of information after that test completes.",

The table contains zero, one, or many rows at any moment, depending upon the number of alarm conditions in effect. The table is initially empty at agent startup. The agent creates a row in the table each time a condition is detected and deletes that row when that condition no longer pertains. The agent creates the first row with upsAlarmId equal to 1, and increments the value of upsAlarmId each time a new row is created, wrapping to the first free value greater than or equal to 1 when the maximum value of upsAlarmId would otherwise be exceeded. Consequently, after multiple operations, the table may become sparse, e.g., containing entries for rows 95, 100, 101, and 203 and the entries should not be assumed to be in chronological order because upsAlarmId might have wrapped. Alarms are named by an AutonomousType (OBJECT IDENTIFIER), upsAlarmDescr, to allow a single table to reflect well known alarms plus alarms defined by a particular implementation, i.e., as documented in the private enterprise MIB definition for the device. No two rows will have the same value of upsAlarmDescr, since alarms define conditions. In order to meet this requirement, care should be taken in the definition of alarm conditions to insure that a system cannot enter the same condition multiple times simultaneously. The number of rows in the table at any given time is reflected by the value of upsAlarmsPresent.",

In addition, any action that results in a row being added or deleted from any table in the Printer MIB is considered a configuration change. Such changes will often affect the capability of the printer to service certain types of print jobs. Management applications may cache infrequently changed configuration information about sub units within the printer. This object should be incremented whenever the agent wishes to notify management applications that any cached configuration information for this device is to be considered 'stale'. At this point, the management application should flush any configuration information cached about this device and fetch new configuration information. The following are examples of actions that would cause the prtGeneralConfigChanges object to be incremented: - Adding an output bin - Changing the media in a sensing input tray - Changing the value of prtInputMediaType Note that the prtGeneralConfigChanges counter would not be incremented when an input tray is temporarily removed to load additional paper or when the level of an input device changes.

                                                "description": "Auxiliary information to allow a printing application to use the channel for data submission to the printer. An application capable of using a specific PrtChannelType should be able to use the combined information from the prtChannelInformation and other channel and interface group objects to 'bootstrap' its use of the channel. prtChannelInformation is not intended to provide a general channel description, nor to provide information that is available once the channel is in use. The encoding and interpretation of the prtChannelInformation object is specific to channel type. The description of each PrtChannelType enum value for which prtChannelInformation is defined specifies the appropriate encoding and interpretation, including interaction with other objects. For channel types that do not specify a prtChannelInformation value, its value shall be null (0 length). When a new PrtChannelType enumeration value is registered, its accompanying description must specify the encoding and interpretation of the prtChannelInformation value for the channel type. prtChannelInformation semantics for an existing PrtChannelType may be added or amended in the same manner as described in section 2.4.1 for type 2 enumeration values. The prtChannelInformation specifies values for a collection of channel attributes, represented as text according to the following rules: 1. The prtChannelInformation is not affected by localization. 2. The prtChannelInformation is a list of entries representing the attribute values. Each entry consists of the following items, in order: a. A keyword, composed of alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z) represented by their NVT ASCII [RFC854] codes, that identifies a channel attribute, b. The NVT ASCII code for an Equals Sign (=) (code 61) to delimit the keyword, c. A data value encoded using rules specific to the PrtChannelType to with the prtChannelInformation applies which must in no case allow an octet with value 10 (the NVT ASCII Line Feed code), d. the NVT ASCII code for a Line Feed character (code 10) to delimit the data value. No other octets shall be present. Keywords are case-sensitive. Conventionally, keywords are capitalized (including each word of a multi-word keyword) and since they occupy space in the prtChannelInformation, they are kept short. 3. If a channel attribute has multiple values, it is represented by multiple entries with the same keyword, each specifying one value. Otherwise, there shall be at most one entry for each attribute. 4. By default, entries may appear in any order. If there are ordering constraints for particular entries, these must be specified in their definitions. 5. The prtChannelInformation value by default consists of text represented by NVT ASCII graphics character codes. However, other representations may be specified: a. In cases where the prtChannelInformation value contains information not normally coded in textual form, whatever symbolic representation is conventionally used for the information should be used for encoding the prtChannelInformation value. (For instance, a binary port value might be represented as a decimal number using NVT ASCII codes.) Such encoding must be specified in the definition of the value. b. The value may contain textual information in a character set other than NVT ASCII graphics characters. (For instance, an identifier might consist of ISO 10646 text encoded using the UTF-8 encoding scheme.) Such a character set and its encoding must be specified in the definition of the value. 6. For each PrtChannelType for which prtChannelInformation entries are defined, the descriptive text associated with the PrtChannelType enumeration value shall specify the following information for each entry: Title: Brief description phrase, e.g.: 'Port name', 'Service Name', etc. Keyword: The keyword value, e.g.: 'Port' or 'Service' Syntax: The encoding of the entry value if it cannot be directly represented by NVT ASCII. Status: 'Mandatory', 'Optional', or 'Conditionally Mandatory' Multiplicity: 'Single' or 'Multiple' to indicate whether the entry may be present multiple times. Description: Description of the use of the entry, other information required to complete the definition (e.g.: ordering constraints, interactions between entries). Applications that interpret prtChannelInformation should ignore unrecognized entries, so they are not affected if new entry types are added.",

When the printer adds an alert to the table, that alert is assigned the next higher integer value from the last item entered into the table. If the index value reaches its maximum value, the next index value used must be 1. NOTE: The management application will read the alert table when a trap or event notification occurs or at a periodic rate and then parse the table to determine if any new entries were added by comparing the last known index value with the current highest index value. The management application will then update its copy of the alert table. When the printer discovers that an alert is no longer active, the printer shall remove the row for that alert from the table and shall reduce the number of rows in the table. The printer may add or delete any number of rows from the table at any time. The management station can detect when binary change alerts have been deleted by requesting an attribute of each alert, and noting alerts as deleted when that retrieval is not possible.

Sibling components are defined as entPhysicalEntries that share the same instance values of each of the entPhysicalContainedIn and entPhysicalClass objects. An NMS can use this object to identify the relative ordering for all sibling components of a particular parent (identified by the entPhysicalContainedIn instance in each sibling entry). If possible, this value should match any external labeling of the physical component. For example, for a container (e.g., card slot) labeled as 'slot #3', entPhysicalParentRelPos should have the value '3'. Note that the entPhysicalEntry for the module plugged in slot 3 should have an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '1'. If the physical position of this component does not match any external numbering or clearly visible ordering, then user documentation or other external reference material should be used to determine the parent-relative position. If this is not possible, then the agent should assign a consistent (but possibly arbitrary) ordering to a given set of 'sibling' components, perhaps based on internal representation of the components. If the agent cannot determine the parent-relative position for some reason, or if the associated value of entPhysicalContainedIn is '0', then the value '-1' is returned. Otherwise, a non-negative integer is returned, indicating the parent-relative position of this physical entity. Parent-relative ordering normally starts from '1' and continues to 'N', where 'N' represents the highest positioned child entity. However, if the physical entities (e.g., slots) are labeled from a starting position of zero, then the first sibling should be associated with an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '0'. Note that this ordering may be sparse or dense, depending on agent implementation. The actual values returned are not globally meaningful, as each 'parent' component may use different numbering algorithms. The ordering is only meaningful among siblings of the same parent component. The agent should retain parent-relative position values across reboots, either through algorithmic assignment or use of non-volatile storage.",

Note that an agent may return a community string with read-only privileges, even if this object is accessed with a read-write community string. However, the agent must take care not to return a community string that allows more privileges than the community string used to access this object. A compliant SNMP agent may wish to conserve naming scopes by representing multiple logical entities in a single 'default' naming scope. This is possible when the logical entities, represented by the same value of entLogicalCommunity, have no object instances in common. For example, 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' may be part of the main naming scope, but at least one additional community string is needed to represent 'bridge2' and 'repeater2'. Logical entities 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' would be represented by sysOREntries associated with the 'default' naming scope. For agents not accessible via SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c, the value of this object is the empty string. This object may also contain an empty string if a community string has not yet been assigned by the agent or if no community string with suitable access rights can be returned for a particular SNMP request. Note that this object is deprecated. Agents that implement SNMPv3 access should use the entLogicalContextEngineID and entLogicalContextName objects to identify the context associated with each logical entity. SNMPv3 agents may return a zero-length string for this object or may continue to return a community string (e.g., tri-lingual agent support).",

For each logical entity known by this agent, there are zero or more mappings to the physical resources, which are used to realize that logical entity.

For example, in a system that contains a single power supply, mappings between logical entities and the power supply are not useful and should not be included. Also, only the most appropriate physical component, which is closest to the root of a particular containment tree, should be identified in an entLPMapping entry. For example, suppose a bridge is realized on a particular module, and all ports on that module are ports on this bridge. A mapping between the bridge and the module would be useful, but additional mappings between the bridge and each of the ports on that module would be redundant (because the entPhysicalContainedIn hierarchy can provide the same information). On the other hand, if more than one bridge were utilizing ports on this module, then mappings between each bridge and the ports it used would be appropriate. Also, in the case of a single backplane repeater, a mapping for the backplane to the single repeater entity is not necessary.",

It can be utilized by an NMS to trigger logical/physical entity table maintenance polls. An agent should not generate more than one entConfigChange 'notification-event' in a given time interval (five seconds is the suggested default). A 'notification-event' is the transmission of a single trap or inform PDU to a list of notification destinations. If additional configuration changes occur within the throttling period, then notification-events for these changes should be suppressed by the agent until the current throttling period expires. At the end of a throttling period, one notification-event should be generated if any configuration changes occurred since the start of the throttling period. In such a case, another throttling period is started right away. An NMS should periodically check the value of entLastChangeTime to detect any missed entConfigChange notification-events, e.g., due to throttling or transmission loss.",

An application can have one, and only one element that is designated as the primary executable. The execution of this element constitutes an invocation of the application. This is used by the agent implementation to determine the initiation of an application. The primary executable must remain running long enough for the agent implementation to detect its presence. required(3), An application may have zero or more required elements. All required elements must be running in order for the application to be judged to be running and healthy. dependent(4), An application may have zero or more dependent elements. Dependent elements may not be running unless required elements are. unknown(5) Default value for the case when an operator has not yet assigned one of the other values. When set, bits 1, 2, 3, and 4 have no meaning. sysApplInstallElmtRole is used by the agent implementation in determining the initiation of an application, the current state of a running application (see sysApplRunCurrentState), when an application invocation is no longer running, and the exit status of a terminated application invocation (see sysApplPastRunExitState).",

Each entry represents a process which has previously executed and is associated with the invoked application of which it was a part. Because an invoked application may involve more than one executable, it is possible to have multiple entries in this table for each application invocation. Entries are added to this table when the corresponding process in the sysApplElmtRun Table terminates. Entries remain in this table until they are aged out when either the number of entries in the table reaches a maximum as determined by sysApplElmtPastRunMaxRows, or when an entry has aged to exceed a time limit as set by sysApplElmtPastRunTblTimeLimit. When aging out entries, the oldest entry, as determined by the value of sysApplElmtPastRunTimeEnded, will be removed first. The table is indexed by sysApplInstallPkgIndex (from the sysApplInstallPkgTable), sysApplElmtPastRunInvocID, and sysApplElmtPastRunIndex to make it easy to locate all previously executed processes of a particular invoked application that has been installed on the system.",

NOTE: if the process can not be associated back to an invoked application installed on the system, then the value returned for the columnar value sysApplMapInstallPkgIndex will be '0' and the instance portion of the object-identifier will be the process ID number (sysApplElmtRunIndex) followed by 0.0.",

If the object's appearance caused the trigger firing, the object MUST vanish before the trigger can be fired again for it, and vice versa. If the trigger fired due to a change in the object's value, it will be fired again on every successive value change for that object. For 'boolean', the specific test is as selected by mteTriggerBooleanTest. If the test result is true the trigger fires. The trigger will not fire again until the value has become false and come back to true. For 'threshold' the test works as described below for mteTriggerThresholdStartup, mteTriggerThresholdRising, and mteTriggerThresholdFalling.

Bad object identifiers or a mismatch between truncating the identifier and the value of mteTriggerValueIDWildcard result in operation as one would expect when providing the wrong identifier to a Get or GetNext operation. The Get will fail or get the wrong object. The GetNext will indeed get whatever is next, proceeding until it runs past the initial part of the identifier and perhaps many unintended objects for confusing results. If the value syntax of those objects is not usable, that results in a 'badType' error that terminates the scan.

A frequency of 0 indicates instantaneous recognition of the condition. This is not possible in many cases, but may be supported in cases where it makes sense and the system is able to do so. This feature allows the MIB to be used in implementations where such interrupt-driven behavior is possible and is not likely to be supported for all MIB objects even then since such sampling generally has to be tightly integrated into low-level code. Systems that can support this SHOULD document those cases where it can be used. In cases where it can not, setting this object to 0 should be disallowed.",

Bad object identifiers or a mismatch between truncating the identifier and the value of mteDeltaDiscontinuityIDWildcard result in operation as one would expect when providing the wrong identifier to a Get operation. The Get will fail or get the wrong object. If the object is not available it is omitted from the notification.",

Note that the time interval that an application waits for a response may actually be derived from the value of this object. The method for deriving the actual time interval is implementation dependent. One such method is to derive the expected round trip time based on a particular retransmission algorithm and on the number of timeouts which have occurred. The type of message may also be considered when deriving expected round trip times for retransmissions. For example, if a message is being sent with a securityLevel that indicates both authentication and privacy, the derived value may be increased to compensate for extra processing time spent during authentication and encryption processing.",

Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a sub-identifier of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, with the most significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet string value (extended if necessary, see below) corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th sub-identifier, and the least significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16. Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER matches this family of filter subtrees; a '1' indicates that an exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild card', i.e., any sub-identifier value matches. Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object instance is contained in a family of filter subtrees if, for each sub-identifier of the value of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, either: the i-th bit of snmpNotifyFilterMask is 0, or the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th sub-identifier of the value of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree. If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and there are more than M sub-identifiers in the corresponding instance of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be the required length. Note that when the value of this object is the zero-length string, this extension rule results in a mask of all-1's being used (i.e., no 'wild card'), and the family of filter subtrees is the one subtree uniquely identified by the corresponding instance of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree.",

When a new user is created (i.e., a new conceptual row is instantiated in this table), the privacy and authentication parameters of the new user must be cloned from its clone-from user. These parameters are: - authentication protocol (usmUserAuthProtocol) - privacy protocol (usmUserPrivProtocol) They will be copied regardless of what the current value is. Cloning also causes the initial values of the secret authentication key (authKey) and the secret encryption key (privKey) of the new user to be set to the same values as the corresponding secrets of the clone-from user to allow the KeyChange process to occur as required during user creation. The first time an instance of this object is set by a management operation (either at or after its instantiation), the cloning process is invoked. Subsequent writes are successful but invoke no action to be taken by the receiver. The cloning process fails with an 'inconsistentName' error if the conceptual row representing the clone-from user does not exist or is not in an active state when the cloning process is invoked. When this object is read, the ZeroDotZero OID is returned. ",

If so, then the key change succeeded and the new key is active (probably the response got lost).

To determine whether access is allowed, one entry from this table needs to be selected and the proper viewName from that entry must be used for access control checking. To select the proper entry, follow these steps: 1) the set of possible matches is formed by the intersection of the following sets of entries: the set of entries with identical vacmGroupName the union of these two sets: - the set with identical vacmAccessContextPrefix - the set of entries with vacmAccessContextMatch value of 'prefix' and matching vacmAccessContextPrefix intersected with the union of these two sets: - the set of entries with identical vacmSecurityModel - the set of entries with vacmSecurityModel value of 'any' intersected with the set of entries with vacmAccessSecurityLevel value less than or equal to the requested securityLevel 2) if this set has only one member, we're done otherwise, it comes down to deciding how to weight the preferences between ContextPrefixes, SecurityModels, and SecurityLevels as follows: a) if the subset of entries with securityModel matching the securityModel in the message is not empty, then discard the rest. b) if the subset of entries with vacmAccessContextPrefix matching the contextName in the message is not empty, then discard the rest c) discard all entries with ContextPrefixes shorter than the longest one remaining in the set d) select the entry with the highest securityLevel Please note that for securityLevel noAuthNoPriv, all groups are really equivalent since the assumption that the securityName has been authenticated does not hold.

The name of the view to be created should be determined to be unique by the SNMP Command Generator application by consulting the vacmViewTreeFamilyTable. Finally, the named view may be created (Set), including the advisory lock.

Each MIB view is defined by two sets of view subtrees: - the included view subtrees, and - the excluded view subtrees. Every such view subtree, both the included and the excluded ones, is defined in this table. To determine if a particular object instance is in a particular MIB view, compare the object instance's OBJECT IDENTIFIER with each of the MIB view's active entries in this table. If none match, then the object instance is not in the MIB view. If one or more match, then the object instance is included in, or excluded from, the MIB view according to the value of vacmViewTreeFamilyType in the entry whose value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree has the most sub-identifiers. If multiple entries match and have the same number of sub-identifiers (when wildcarding is specified with the value of vacmViewTreeFamilyMask), then the lexicographically greatest instance of vacmViewTreeFamilyType determines the inclusion or exclusion. An object instance's OBJECT IDENTIFIER X matches an active entry in this table when the number of sub-identifiers in X is at least as many as in the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree for the entry, and each sub-identifier in the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree matches its corresponding sub-identifier in X. Two sub-identifiers match either if the corresponding bit of the value of vacmViewTreeFamilyMask for the entry is zero (the 'wild card' value), or if they are equal. A 'family' of subtrees is the set of subtrees defined by a particular combination of values of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask. In the case where no 'wild card' is defined in the vacmViewTreeFamilyMask, the family of subtrees reduces to a single subtree. When creating or changing MIB views, an SNMP Command Generator application should utilize the vacmViewSpinLock to try to avoid collisions. See DESCRIPTION clause of vacmViewSpinLock. When creating MIB views, it is strongly advised that first the 'excluded' vacmViewTreeFamilyEntries are created and then the 'included' entries. When deleting MIB views, it is strongly advised that first the 'included' vacmViewTreeFamilyEntries are deleted and then the 'excluded' entries. If a create for an entry for instance-level access control is received and the implementation does not support instance-level granularity, then an inconsistentName error must be returned. ",
