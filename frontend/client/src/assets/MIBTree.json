Note that in the context of the Internet suite of protocols, values should be calculated accordingly: layer functionality 1 physical (e.g., repeaters) 2 datalink/subnetwork (e.g., bridges) 3 internet (e.g., supports the IP) 4 end-to-end (e.g., supports the TCP) 7 applications (e.g., supports the SMTP) For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6 may also be counted.",

Those systems that do not provide per-interface control of the forwarding function should set this object to forwarding for all interfaces and allow the ipv6IpForwarding object to control the forwarding capability.

For example, when the node configures both a unicast and anycast address for a prefix, the ipAddressPrefix objects for those addresses will point to a single row in this table. This table primarily provides support for IPv6 prefixes, and several of the objects are less meaningful for IPv4. The table continues to allow IPv4 addresses to allow future flexibility. In order to promote a common configuration, this document includes suggestions for default values for IPv4 prefixes. Each of these values may be overridden if an object is meaningful to the node. All prefixes used by this entity should be included in this table independent of how the entity learned the prefix. (This table isn't limited to prefixes learned from router advertisements.)",

Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipNetToPhysicalTable. That is, it effectively dis- associates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipNetToPhysicalType object. The 'dynamic(3)' type indicates that the IP address to physical addresses mapping has been dynamically resolved using e.g., IPv4 ARP or the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol. The 'static(4)' type indicates that the mapping has been statically configured. Both of these refer to entries that provide mappings for other entities addresses. The 'local(5)' type indicates that the mapping is provided for an entity's own interface address. As the entries in this table are typically not persistent when this object is written the entity SHOULD NOT save the change to non-volatile storage.

In order to use this lock to coordinate the use of set operations, managers should first retrieve ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock. They should then determine the appropriate row to create or modify. Finally, they should issue the appropriate set command including the retrieved value of ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock. If another manager has altered the table in the meantime, then the value of ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock will have changed and the creation will fail as it will be specifying an incorrect value for ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock. It is suggested, but not required, that the ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock be the first var bind for each set of objects representing a 'row' in a PDU.",

The address type in this table represents the address type used for the communication, irrespective of the higher-layer abstraction. For example, an application using IPv6 'sockets' to communicate via IPv4 between ::ffff:10.0.0.1 and ::ffff:10.0.0.2 would use InetAddressType ipv4(1). Unlike the udpTable in RFC 2013, this table also allows the representation of an application that completely specifies both local and remote addresses and ports. A listening application is represented in three possible ways: 1) An application that is willing to accept both IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams is represented by a udpEndpointLocalAddressType of unknown(0) and a udpEndpointLocalAddress of ''h (a zero-length octet-string). 2) An application that is willing to accept only IPv4 or only IPv6 datagrams is represented by a udpEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate address type and a udpEndpointLocalAddress of '0.0.0.0' or '::' respectively. 3) An application that is listening for datagrams only for a specific IP address but from any remote system is represented by a udpEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate address type, with udpEndpointLocalAddress specifying the local address. In all cases where the remote is a wildcard, the udpEndpointRemoteAddressType is unknown(0), the udpEndpointRemoteAddress is ''h (a zero-length octet-string), and the udpEndpointRemotePort is 0. If the operating system is demultiplexing UDP packets by remote address and port, or if the application has 'connected' the socket specifying a default remote address and port, the udpEndpointRemote* values should be used to reflect this.",

When set, this variable causes a Start or Stop event on the specified neighbor, as specified on pages 8-10 of RFC 904. Briefly, a Start event causes an Idle peer to begin neighbor acquisition and a non-Idle peer to reinitiate neighbor acquisition. A stop event causes a non-Idle peer to return to the Idle state until a Start event occurs, either via egpNeighEventTrigger or otherwise. Enumeration: 'start': 1, 'stop': 2.",

Each octet within the value of this object specifies a set of eight ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through 8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc. Within each octet, the most significant bit represents the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit represents the highest numbered port. Thus, each port of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the value of this object. If that bit has a value of '1', then that port is included in the set of ports; the port is not included if its bit has a value of '0'. (Note that the setting of the bit corresponding to the port from which a frame is received is irrelevant.) The default value of this object is a string of ones of appropriate length. The value of this object may exceed the required minimum maximum message size of some SNMP transport (484 bytes, in the case of SNMP over UDP, see RFC 3417, section 3.2). SNMP engines on bridges supporting a large number of ports must support appropriate maximum message sizes.",

An entry shall be placed in the storage table for each logical area of storage that is allocated and has fixed resource limits. The amount of storage represented in an entity is the amount actually usable by the requesting entity, and excludes loss due to formatting or file system reference information. These entries are associated with logical storage areas, as might be seen by an application, rather than physical storage entities which are typically seen by an operating system. Storage such as tapes and floppies without file systems on them are typically not allocated in chunks by the operating system to requesting applications, and therefore shouldn't appear in this table. Examples of valid storage for this table include disk partitions, file systems, ram (for some architectures this is further segmented into regular memory, extended memory, and so on), backing store for virtual memory (`swap space'). This table is intended to be a useful diagnostic for `out of memory' and `out of buffers' types of failures. In addition, it can be a useful performance monitoring tool for tracking memory, disk, or buffer usage.",

                                        "description": "This table contains one entry per interface. It defines objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent to test an interface for various faults. Tests for an interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that interface. After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to determine the outcome. If an agent can not perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate. The object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test- specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific) information concerning the outcome of the test. Only one test can be in progress on each interface at any one time. If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the second test is rejected. Some agents may reject a test when a prior test is active on another interface. Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the interface to be tested. This is accomplished with the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows: try_again: get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) while (ifTestStatus != notInUse) /* * Loop while a test is running or some other * manager is configuring a test. */ short delay get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) } /* * Is not being used right now -- let's compete * to see who gets it. */ lock_value = ifTestId if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse, ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE) /* * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go * try again */ goto try_again; /* * I have the lock */ set up any test parameters. /* * This starts the test */ set(ifTestType = test_to_run); wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse' retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid A manager station first retrieves the value of the appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'. The manager station then tries to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself. If the set operation succeeds then the manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the semantics of TestAndIncr). Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry. Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType. On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to 'notInUse'. Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the results. In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be a possibility that the first test's results might be overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first results being read. This unlikely circumstance can be detected by a network manager retrieving ifTestId at the same time as retrieving the test results, and ensuring that the results are for the desired request. If ifTestType is not set within an abnormally long period of time after ownership is obtained, the agent should time-out the manager, and reset the value of the ifTestStatus object back to 'notInUse'. It is suggested that this time-out period be 5 minutes. In general, a management station must not retransmit a request to invoke a test for which it does not receive a response; instead, it properly inspects an agent's MIB to determine if the invocation was successful. Only if the invocation was unsuccessful, is the invocation request retransmitted. Some tests may require the interface to be taken off-line in order to execute them, or may even require the agent to reboot after completion of the test. In these circumstances, communication with the management station invoking the test may be lost until after completion of the test. An agent is not required to support such tests. However, if such tests are supported, then the agent should make every effort to transmit a response to the request which invoked the test prior to losing communication. When the agent is restored to normal service, the results of the test are properly made available in the appropriate objects. Note that this requires that the ifIndex value assigned to an interface must be unchanged even if the test causes a reboot. An agent must reject any test for which it cannot, perhaps due to resource constraints, make available at least the minimum amount of information after that test completes.",

The table contains zero, one, or many rows at any moment, depending upon the number of alarm conditions in effect. The table is initially empty at agent startup. The agent creates a row in the table each time a condition is detected and deletes that row when that condition no longer pertains. The agent creates the first row with upsAlarmId equal to 1, and increments the value of upsAlarmId each time a new row is created, wrapping to the first free value greater than or equal to 1 when the maximum value of upsAlarmId would otherwise be exceeded. Consequently, after multiple operations, the table may become sparse, e.g., containing entries for rows 95, 100, 101, and 203 and the entries should not be assumed to be in chronological order because upsAlarmId might have wrapped. Alarms are named by an AutonomousType (OBJECT IDENTIFIER), upsAlarmDescr, to allow a single table to reflect well known alarms plus alarms defined by a particular implementation, i.e., as documented in the private enterprise MIB definition for the device. No two rows will have the same value of upsAlarmDescr, since alarms define conditions. In order to meet this requirement, care should be taken in the definition of alarm conditions to insure that a system cannot enter the same condition multiple times simultaneously. The number of rows in the table at any given time is reflected by the value of upsAlarmsPresent.",

A configuration change is defined to be an action that results in a change to any MIB object other than those that reflect status or level, or those that act as counters or gauges. In addition, any action that results in a row being added or deleted from any table in the Printer MIB is considered a configuration change. Such changes will often affect the capability of the printer to service certain types of print jobs. Management applications may cache infrequently changed configuration information about sub units within the printer. This object should be incremented whenever the agent wishes to notify management applications that any cached configuration information for this device is to be considered 'stale'. At this point, the management application should flush any configuration information cached about this device and fetch new configuration information. The following are examples of actions that would cause the prtGeneralConfigChanges object to be incremented: - Adding an output bin - Changing the media in a sensing input tray - Changing the value of prtInputMediaType Note that the prtGeneralConfigChanges counter would not be incremented when an input tray is temporarily removed to load additional paper or when the level of an input device changes.

An application capable of using a specific PrtChannelType should be able to use the combined information from the prtChannelInformation and other channel and interface group objects to 'bootstrap' its use of the channel. prtChannelInformation is not intended to provide a general channel description, nor to provide information that is available once the channel is in use. The encoding and interpretation of the prtChannelInformation object is specific to channel type. The description of each PrtChannelType enum value for which prtChannelInformation is defined specifies the appropriate encoding and interpretation, including interaction with other objects. For channel types that do not specify a prtChannelInformation value, its value shall be null (0 length). When a new PrtChannelType enumeration value is registered, its accompanying description must specify the encoding and interpretation of the prtChannelInformation value for the channel type. prtChannelInformation semantics for an existing PrtChannelType may be added or amended in the same manner as described in section 2.4.1 for type 2 enumeration values. The prtChannelInformation specifies values for a collection of channel attributes, represented as text according to the following rules: 1. The prtChannelInformation is not affected by localization. 2. The prtChannelInformation is a list of entries representing the attribute values. Each entry consists of the following items, in order: a. A keyword, composed of alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z) represented by their NVT ASCII [RFC854] codes, that identifies a channel attribute, b. The NVT ASCII code for an Equals Sign (=) (code 61) to delimit the keyword, c. A data value encoded using rules specific to the PrtChannelType to with the prtChannelInformation applies which must in no case allow an octet with value 10 (the NVT ASCII Line Feed code), d. the NVT ASCII code for a Line Feed character (code 10) to delimit the data value. No other octets shall be present. Keywords are case-sensitive. Conventionally, keywords are capitalized (including each word of a multi-word keyword) and since they occupy space in the prtChannelInformation, they are kept short. 3. If a channel attribute has multiple values, it is represented by multiple entries with the same keyword, each specifying one value. Otherwise, there shall be at most one entry for each attribute. 4. By default, entries may appear in any order. If there are ordering constraints for particular entries, these must be specified in their definitions. 5. The prtChannelInformation value by default consists of text represented by NVT ASCII graphics character codes. However, other representations may be specified: a. In cases where the prtChannelInformation value contains information not normally coded in textual form, whatever symbolic representation is conventionally used for the information should be used for encoding the prtChannelInformation value. (For instance, a binary port value might be represented as a decimal number using NVT ASCII codes.) Such encoding must be specified in the definition of the value. b. The value may contain textual information in a character set other than NVT ASCII graphics characters. (For instance, an identifier might consist of ISO 10646 text encoded using the UTF-8 encoding scheme.) Such a character set and its encoding must be specified in the definition of the value. 6. For each PrtChannelType for which prtChannelInformation entries are defined, the descriptive text associated with the PrtChannelType enumeration value shall specify the following information for each entry: Title: Brief description phrase, e.g.: 'Port name', 'Service Name', etc. Keyword: The keyword value, e.g.: 'Port' or 'Service' Syntax: The encoding of the entry value if it cannot be directly represented by NVT ASCII. Status: 'Mandatory', 'Optional', or 'Conditionally Mandatory' Multiplicity: 'Single' or 'Multiple' to indicate whether the entry may be present multiple times. Description: Description of the use of the entry, other information required to complete the definition (e.g.: ordering constraints, interactions between entries). Applications that interpret prtChannelInformation should ignore unrecognized entries, so they are not affected if new entry types are added.",

Sibling components are defined as entPhysicalEntries that share the same instance values of each of the entPhysicalContainedIn and entPhysicalClass objects. An NMS can use this object to identify the relative ordering for all sibling components of a particular parent (identified by the entPhysicalContainedIn instance in each sibling entry). If possible, this value should match any external labeling of the physical component. For example, for a container (e.g., card slot) labeled as 'slot #3', entPhysicalParentRelPos should have the value '3'. Note that the entPhysicalEntry for the module plugged in slot 3 should have an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '1'. If the physical position of this component does not match any external numbering or clearly visible ordering, then user documentation or other external reference material should be used to determine the parent-relative position. If this is not possible, then the agent should assign a consistent (but possibly arbitrary) ordering to a given set of 'sibling' components, perhaps based on internal representation of the components. If the agent cannot determine the parent-relative position for some reason, or if the associated value of entPhysicalContainedIn is '0', then the value '-1' is returned. Otherwise, a non-negative integer is returned, indicating the parent-relative position of this physical entity. Parent-relative ordering normally starts from '1' and continues to 'N', where 'N' represents the highest positioned child entity. However, if the physical entities (e.g., slots) are labeled from a starting position of zero, then the first sibling should be associated with an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '0'. Note that this ordering may be sparse or dense, depending on agent implementation. The actual values returned are not globally meaningful, as each 'parent' component may use different numbering algorithms. The ordering is only meaningful among siblings of the same parent component. The agent should retain parent-relative position values across reboots, either through algorithmic assignment or use of non-volatile storage.",

The agent should allow read access with this community string (to an appropriate subset of all managed objects) and may also return a community string based on the privileges of the request used to read this object. Note that an agent may return a community string with read-only privileges, even if this object is accessed with a read-write community string. However, the agent must take care not to return a community string that allows more privileges than the community string used to access this object. A compliant SNMP agent may wish to conserve naming scopes by representing multiple logical entities in a single 'default' naming scope. This is possible when the logical entities, represented by the same value of entLogicalCommunity, have no object instances in common. For example, 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' may be part of the main naming scope, but at least one additional community string is needed to represent 'bridge2' and 'repeater2'. Logical entities 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' would be represented by sysOREntries associated with the 'default' naming scope. For agents not accessible via SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c, the value of this object is the empty string. This object may also contain an empty string if a community string has not yet been assigned by the agent or if no community string with suitable access rights can be returned for a particular SNMP request. Note that this object is deprecated. Agents that implement SNMPv3 access should use the entLogicalContextEngineID and entLogicalContextName objects to identify the context associated with each logical entity. SNMPv3 agents may return a zero-length string for this object or may continue to return a community string (e.g., tri-lingual agent support).",

For example, in a system that contains a single power supply, mappings between logical entities and the power supply are not useful and should not be included. Also, only the most appropriate physical component, which is closest to the root of a particular containment tree, should be identified in an entLPMapping entry. For example, suppose a bridge is realized on a particular module, and all ports on that module are ports on this bridge. A mapping between the bridge and the module would be useful, but additional mappings between the bridge and each of the ports on that module would be redundant (because the entPhysicalContainedIn hierarchy can provide the same information). On the other hand, if more than one bridge were utilizing ports on this module, then mappings between each bridge and the ports it used would be appropriate.

For example, to indicate that a particular interface (e.g., physical component 33) is identified by the same value of ifIndex for all logical entities, the following instance might exist: entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.5 In the event an entPhysicalEntry is associated differently for some logical entities, additional entAliasMapping entries may exist, e.g.: entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.6 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.4 = ifIndex.1 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.5 = ifIndex.1 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.10 = ifIndex.12 Note that entries with non-zero entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero index values have precedence over zero-indexed entries.

For repeater ports, the appropriate row in the 'rptrPortGroupTable' should be identified instead. For example, suppose a physical port was represented by entPhysicalEntry.3, entLogicalEntry.15 existed for a repeater, and entLogicalEntry.22 existed for a bridge. Then there might be two related instances of entAliasMappingIdentifier: entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.15 == rptrPortGroupIndex.5.2 entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.22 == ifIndex.17 It is possible that other mappings (besides interfaces and repeater ports) may be defined in the future, as required.

It can be utilized by an NMS to trigger logical/physical entity table maintainance polls. An agent should not generate more than one entConfigChange 'notification-event' in a given time interval (five seconds is the suggested default). A 'notification-event' is the transmission of a single trap or inform PDU to a list of notification destinations. If additional configuration changes occur within the throttling period, then notification-events for these changes should be suppressed by the agent until the current throttling period expires. At the end of a throttling period, one notification-event should be generated if any configuration changes occurred since the start of the throttling period. In such a case, another throttling period is started right away. An NMS should periodically check the value of entLastChangeTime to detect any missed entConfigChange notification-events, e.g., due to throttling or transmission loss.",
